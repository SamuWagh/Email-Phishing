🛡️ Email Phishing Detection
Smart Identification of Malicious Emails using ANN

🚨 Detect • Prevent • Secure 🚨

</div>
✨ Why This Project?

Phishing emails are one of the most common cyber-attacks today. They deceive users into revealing sensitive information by pretending to be trustworthy sources.

This project tackles the problem by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to intelligently distinguish between phishing and legitimate emails through machine learning.

🧩 What’s Inside?

✔ Data preprocessing & analysis
✔ Feature extraction from email content
✔ ANN-based classification model
✔ Performance evaluation & visualization
✔ Fully documented Jupyter Notebook
